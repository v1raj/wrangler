i have added the changes to the antlr file. Where do i now run mvn compile
im going to give you the antlr file explain it to me: https://github.com/data-integrations/wrangler
(a) Grammar Modi

cation (wrangler-core/src/main/antlr4/.../Directives.g4):
○ Add the lexer rules for BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION (including helper
fragments BYTE_UNIT, TIME_UNIT).
○ Modify relevant parser rules (e.g., value, or create new speci

c rules like
byteSizeArg, timeDurationArg) to accept BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION
tokens where appropriate for directive arguments.
○ Regenerate the ANTLR Java parser/lexer code using the appropriate build
process (e.g., mvn compile). this is the question i have to solve on the antlr file i have given you
Modify relevant parser rules (e.g., value, or create new speci

c rules like
byteSizeArg, timeDurationArg) to accept BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION
tokens where appropriate for directive arguments.
○ Regenerate the ANTLR Java parser/lexer code using the appropriate build
process (e.g., mvn compile). how do i solve these two parts
(b) API Updates (wrangler-api module):
○ Create new Java classes ByteSize.java and TimeDuration.java extending Token
[wrangler-api/src/main/java/io/cdap/wrangler/api/parser/Token.java]

■ These classes should parse the token string (e.g., "10KB", "150ms") in
their constructor.
■ Provide methods to retrieve the value in a canonical unit (e.g., long
getBytes() for ByteSize)
○ Add BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION to the Token Types
○ Update usage de

nition and token de

nition to support specifying these new

token types as valid directive arguments.
Add BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION to the Token Types
○ Update usage de

nition and token de

nition to support specifying these new

token types as valid directive arguments. solve this part
what does this whole wrangler project do im not getting the whole context 

where do i have to define byteSizeArg and timeDurationarg

BYTE_SIZE: Digit ('.' Digit)? BYTE_UNIT;
TIME_DURATION: Digit ('.' Digit)? TIME_UNIT;


fragment BYTE_UNIT : ('B' | 'KB' | 'MB' | 'GB' | 'TB' | 'PB' | 'EB');
fragment TIME_UNIT : ('ns' | 'us' | 'ms' | 's' | 'm' | 'h' | 'd') ;  this is how i have defined it

where has the bytesize and timeduration token classes defined? and since i have defined it as BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION in value how are these functions being added to ctx
i cant access directivesparser can i know for sure that it will have visitValue function as the grammar automatically generates these functions
how does the execute function get the summation of the values in the row without a for loop
